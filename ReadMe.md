# Hostel Management System

### Overview
The Hostel Management System is a C++ program designed to manage the operations of a hostel, including room allocation, student bookings, and room information management. The system allows both students and managers to interact with the hostel's data, making it efficient for day-to-day operations.

### Features

- Manager portal: Managers can perform various tasks, including adding new rooms, viewing room details, and removing rooms from the hostel.
