# Hostel Management System

### Overview
The Hostel Management System is a C++ program designed to manage the operations of a hostel, including room allocation, student bookings, and room information management. The system allows both students and managers to interact with the hostel's data, making it efficient for day-to-day operations.

### Features
- Student portal: Students can view available rooms, book a room, and check their booked room details.
- Manager portal: Managers can perform various tasks, including adding new rooms, viewing room details, and removing rooms from the hostel.
- Room Allocation: The system ensures proper room allocation and keeps track of the current number of occupants in each room.
- Data Persistence: Hostel data, including room details and bookings, is stored in text files, allowing the system to maintain state between runs.This also implements the <span style="background-color: grey;color: blueaccent">Simpleton Pattern</span>
